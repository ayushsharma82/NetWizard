NetWizard Lite (open-source version) and NetWizard Pro are two different versions of the same WiFi manager & captive portal library, each with its own set of features and licensing terms. Here's a comparison between NetWizard Lite, which is open-source and AGPL-3.0 based, and NetWizard Pro, which is SCL-1.1 (SOFTT Commercial License 1.1) based:

1. **Licensing:**
   - NetWizard Lite: This version is open-source and released under the AGPL-3.0 license. It means that it's freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. However, if you use NetWizard Lite in a commercial product, the AGPL-3.0 license requires you to make the source code of your product, including any modifications to NetWizard Lite, available to the public.

   - NetWizard Pro: This version is offered under a one-time charge for a commercial license. It allows you to use NetWizard Pro in a commercial product **without the requirement to open-source your proprietary code**. The commercial license provides more flexibility and protection for businesses.

2. **Support:**
   - NetWizard Lite: Support for NetWizard Lite is typically community-driven. You may find help through online forums, documentation, or user-contributed resources. However, professional support may be limited.

   - NetWizard Pro: NetWizard Pro includes **dedicated support and assistance**. This can be essential for businesses that require timely and reliable support to ensure their product runs reliably.

In summary, the choice between NetWizard Lite and NetWizard Pro depends on your specific needs and the nature of your project:

- If you are working on an open-source project or have no concerns about the AGPL-3.0 license's requirements and need basic WiFi manager functionality, NetWizard Lite is a viable choice.

- If you are developing a commercial product, NetWizard Pro provides a more comprehensive and professionally supported solution while allowing you to maintain the proprietary nature of your code. However, it comes with a one-time commercial licensing fee.
