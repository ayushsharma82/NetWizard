## What is NetWizard?

NetWizard is a WiFi manager library for microcontrollers that have WiFi capabilities. The library is designed to eliminate the need to hard-code WiFi credentials in your project/device which is always a need when you are:

1. Developing a product for market
2. Frequently switching between different WiFi networks
3. Eliminating the need to re-compile your device firmware every time you switch WiFi networks

NetWizard completely handles all the WiFi setup and management tasks, so you don't need to worry about it. It also comes with a captive portal interface that means there's very little friction when setting up your device.

## What is Dynamic Captive Portal?

Often there's a requirement to gather certain parameters from user while they setup the device. This can include MQTT credentials, various application specific settings and all.

To solve this need, **netwizard comes with a dynamic captive portal** that makes it super easy to do this and makes it all possible from C++ itself. You can create these parameters in your C++ code and those will appear automatically in the captive portal for user to fill.
